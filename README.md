### 5. Prime Number Checker
Write a function that checks whether a given number is a prime number.

### 6. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Create a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays against the computer. Use random numbers to generate the computer's move.

### 7. Count Words in a String
Write a program that counts the number of words in a given string. Consider punctuation and multiple spaces between words.

### 8. Find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
Write a function that finds the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

### 9. Simple Password Generator
Create a program that generates a random password with a specified length, including uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

### 10. Guess the Number Game
Write a "Guess the Number" game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player has to guess the number, and the program gives hints (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low") until the player gets it right.
